THESE FILES CONTAIN THE ZED API WE WANTED TO USE. WE DECIDED TO USE THE OBJECT DETECTION ONE WITH THE ZED 2 CAMERA.
IT CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH THE ZED 2 CAMERA. THE FILES WILL GIVE A BASIC FOUNDATION AND YOU WILL HAVE TO GO IN A CHANGE
CODE TO GIVE THE OUTPUT YOU WANT WHICH ZED DOES A GOOD JOB GIVING YOU INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO DO THAT.


ZED REQUIRES A GOOD AMOUNT OF DEPENDCIES BUT WITH THE LATEST JETPACK INSTALL ON THE JETSON THEY SHOULD ALREADY BE
